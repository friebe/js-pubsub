# js-pubsub
Javascript implementation of the Publish/Subscribe pattern

If you've not used pub/sub before, the gist is that you publish to a topic and anyone can subscribe, much like the way a radio works: a radio station broadcasts (publishes) and anyone can listen (subscribes).  This is excellent for highly modular web applications; it's a license to globally communicate without attaching to any specific object.
